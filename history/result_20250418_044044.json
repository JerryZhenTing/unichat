Subtract 5 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3x = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{15}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 5\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]\n\nPlease provide the actual problem you'd like me to solve, and I will respond accordingly.",
