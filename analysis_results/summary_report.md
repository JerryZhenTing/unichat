## Visualizations

The following visualizations have been generated:

1. Consensus Distribution (`consensus_distribution.png`)
2. Confidence Levels (`confidence_levels.png`)
3. Model Agreement Heatmap (`model_agreement.png`)
4. Response Length by Model (`response_length.png`)
5. Success Rate Over Time (`success_over_time.png`)

## Observations and Recommendations

- The system shows a high success rate, indicating good consensus among models.
- chatgpt has a relatively high error rate (43.0%). Check API configuration and error handling.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. Consider enhancing the prompt engineering for models with lower agreement rates.
2. Implement more robust error handling for models with higher error rates.
3. Review patterns in problems with 'no_consensus' status to identify potential improvement areas.
4. Evaluate the balance between different models - consider if all models are providing unique value.
5. Periodically review and update this analysis to track system improvements over time.
